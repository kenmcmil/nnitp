# nnitp

Nnitp is a tool for interpretability of neural network inferences
using Bayesian interpolants. The basic technique is described in
[this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04198). It currently supports
convolutional neural networks for image classification, using the
[Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) framework.

Documentation on nnitp can be found
[here](https://nnitp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


# Install and Run

The pretrained model can be downloaded [here]()

Before install the program, run
'pip install -r requirement.txt'

To install the program, clone the repository and run
'pip install .'

To run the program
'nnitp'

Before you run the program, define environment varibale IMAGENETDIR and
PRETRAINEDDIR as the directory to the imagenet dataset and pretrianed model

'export IMAGENETDIR='path/to/imagenet'
'export PRETRAINED='path/to/pretrained'
